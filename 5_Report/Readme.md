# HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS #

|  ID	  |   Description |
|-------------|:----------------------:|
| HLR1   |    These systems detect droplets of rain on the windshield and automatically turn on and adjust the wiper system in accordance to the level of precipitation. |
| HLR2	  |    A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice and debris from a windscreen or windshield. |
| HLR3   |	   Quality and reliability  wiper systems meet the highest technical requirements and are the basis for vehicles with sophisticated features. |
| HLR4   |    Almost all motor vehicle, including trains, aircraft and watercraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are usually an essential requirement. |
| HLR5   |    Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. |

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS #

| ID	   |  Description |
|-----------:|:------------------------:|
| LLR1	 | A new mechatronic reversing system can now be used to clean the windshield with two wiper arms, whereby one wiper arm is powered directly and the other indirectly using a connection link. |
| LLR2	 | Wiper motor is automatically ON during the time of rainfall. |
| LLR3	 | Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled. |
| LLR4	 | Lower level parsingÂ¶. Under the hood, the Requirement class does most of the heavy lifting. class requirements. |
| LLR5	 | These systems detect droplets of rain on the windshield and automatically turn on and adjust the wiper system. |
